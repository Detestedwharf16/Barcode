# Barcode
STEM Barcode scanner project.

If anyone besides myself or Matthew actually manages to see this feel free to clean up my sloppy code and/or add some bugs/features.

At the moment I'm working on basic data manipulation through csv files to output data sheets useful to mrs. pearson. Since we dont have a barcode scanner availiable, I'm having to use simple test sheets for this.
